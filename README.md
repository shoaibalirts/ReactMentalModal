<h1>React Mental Modal</h1>
<ol>
    <li>I created a tree of React Elements (virtual DOM or fake objects)</li>
    <li>I tell React where to starts adding these elements to the DOM e.g. id=”app”</li>
    <li>React will wait the rest of my JavaScript code to be finished</li>
    <li>Then, React will look at my created tree of React elements (virtual DOM) and look at the actual DOM tree where i wanted to start off and React will update to the actual tree so that real DOM matches the virtual DOM
</li>

</ol>
